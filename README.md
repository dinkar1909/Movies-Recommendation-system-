# Movies-Recommendation-system-
A movie recommendation system helps suggest movies to users based on their preferences. There are two main types of recommendation systems: **Collaborative Filtering** and **Content-Based Filtering**. Collaborative Filtering looks at the preferences of other users who have similar tastes and recommends movies they liked. For example, if you liked a movie, the system might suggest films liked by others with similar ratings. On the other hand, Content-Based Filtering uses the features of movies, like genre or plot, to recommend similar films. Machine learning techniques like **Matrix Factorization** (used in Collaborative Filtering) break down the data to find patterns and similarities. By analyzing user ratings and movie descriptions, the system can predict what movies a user will enjoy next. These systems improve over time by learning from user interactions. They help users discover movies they might not have found on their own. The more data and feedback the system receives, the better it gets at making accurate recommendations.
